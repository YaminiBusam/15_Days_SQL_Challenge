Above Average Product Prices
Question:
Given a list of products and their prices, along with a table of transactions and their amounts, the task was to identify products that are priced above the average transaction amount.
The output required: product_id, product_price, and the average_transaction_price.
Solution:
CREATE TABLE products (
product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
price DECIMAL(10,2)
);

INSERT INTO products (product_id, price) VALUES
(1, 100.00),
(2, 150.00),
(3, 75.00),
(4, 200.00),
(5, 120.00);

CREATE TABLE transactions1 (
transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
product_id INT,
amount DECIMAL(10,2),
FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products(product_id)
);

INSERT INTO transactions1 (transaction_id, product_id, amount) VALUES
(1, 1, 95.00),
(2, 1, 98.00),
(3, 2, 145.00),
(4, 2, 150.00),
(5, 3, 70.00),
(6, 4, 190.00),
(7, 4, 195.00),
(8, 5, 115.00);

create view v1 as
with PT as
(
select p.product_id,p.price,t.transaction_id, t.amount
from products p
join transactions1 t
on p.product_id = t.product_id
)
select *, Avg(amount) over() Avg_amount from  PT 

select distinct product_id, price as product_price, Avg_amount  as avg_transaction_price from v1 where price > Avg_amount
Impact:
This query identifies products consistently outperforming average transaction values, revealing prime upselling candidates and high-margin items that drive revenue growth.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
