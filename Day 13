Click Through Rate By Age
Question:
Find which three age groups had the highest click-through rates (CTR) in 2021. The twist? Age should be based on the exact date of the search event meaning if someone had a birthday during the year, they might fall into a different group for different events.
Solution:
CREATE TABLE users27 (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(100),
birthdate DATETIME
);

INSERT INTO users27 (id, name, birthdate) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', '1995-05-15'),
(2, 'Bob', '1985-03-20'),
(3, 'Charlie', '2005-07-10'),
(4, 'David', '1955-11-30'),
(5, 'Eve', '2015-09-25'),
(6, 'Frank', '1935-02-14'),
(7, 'Grace', '1975-12-01');

CREATE TABLE search_events (
search_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
query VARCHAR(255),
has_clicked Boolean,
user_id INTEGER,
search_time DATETIME,
FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users27(id)
);

INSERT INTO search_events (search_id, query, has_clicked, user_id, search_time) VALUES

(11, 'history', TRUE, 6, '2021-12-01 12:00:00'),

Impact:
User experience insights based on age demographics can drive targeted UI modifications, content curation, and onboarding processesâ€”particularly when older adults demonstrate high engagement rates, allowing platforms to optimize interfaces specifically for their most active user segments.
