# 15_Days_SQL_Challenge
 Welcome to the 15-Day SQL Challenge! 

Think you’ve got what it takes to tackle SQL puzzles and rise to the top? Each day, a fresh challenge awaits—test your skills, sharpen your SQL expertise, and compete for glory!

How It Works:

✅ The SQL Challenge starts on March 24, 2025. A new question drops daily at 12:00 AM Eastern Time.
✅ DO NOT edit/delete the input tables—just write your solution at the end and submit.
✅ You get 3 attempts per question, so strategize wisely!
✅ Each question is worth 10 points—aim for a perfect score.
✅ We use SQLite—refer to the official syntax guide here:  https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html.
